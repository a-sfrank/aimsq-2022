The project is organized under the auspices of the American Institute of
Mathematics (AIM)  [**SQuaREs**](https://aimath.org/programs/squares/) (Structured Quartet Research Ensembles)
program.

## Project summary
This project aims at establishing a theoretical underpinning, supported by numerical simulations, for the axiom that
marine ecosystems transition between multiple metastable states. The approach involves the development of two
mathematical – deterministic and stochastic – modeling frameworks. In the deterministic framework, we describe the
interlink among multiple predator-prey groups. This description is a parsimonious representation of a marine ecosystem.
By extending the deterministic, to a stochastic framework, we aim to mimic the nature of empirical marine ecosystems.
Within this framework, we identify multistable states and probabilistic transitions between these states.
While the stochastic approach is well established in the molecular dynamics framework, its application to food-webs
is novel.
